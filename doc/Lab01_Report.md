>Q. What is the frequency of the blink rate in this example? Note that frequency is the inverse of the time it takes for a cycle. A cycle is the time it takes to go HIGH to LOW to HIGH again. Record a video of your FireBeetle blinking.  Make a note of the answer for now, in the next GIT tutorial, you will get a copy of a sample lab report.

>A. The frequency of the blink rate in this example is 0.666Hz because the frequency is the time it takes to go from HIGH to LOW and back again which the time from HIGH to LOW is 0.5s and LOW to HIGH is 1s. The total time is 1.5 seconds. f=1/T=1/1.5=0.666.

>Q. When you open the conflicted readme, what did you get? How did you fix it?
